GitHub is a web-based platform primarily used for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to store and manage their code, track changes, and collaborate with others on projects. GitHub is built around **Git**,
a distributed version control system, which lets multiple people work on a project at the same time without conflicts.

Key features of GitHub include:

- **Repositories**: Centralized storage spaces for code and project files.
- **Version Control**: Tracks changes to the code over time, allowing users to view, revert, or merge different versions.
- **Branches**: Separate lines of development that can be worked on in parallel, then merged when ready.
- **Pull Requests**: A way to propose changes to a codebase and discuss them before merging.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple users can contribute, review, and manage projects together.
- **Issues & Project Management**: Tools for tracking bugs, enhancements, and tasks.

GitHub also supports open-source collaboration, where developers can contribute to public projects or share their own.
